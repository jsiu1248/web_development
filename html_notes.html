<!--HTML is not a programming language. I'm just trying to document the HTML crash course from Traversy Media
right now.
index.html is the root/home page

The head has page titles and links to CSS files. Meta data and keywords.

Body is where the information is.
Previous HTML versions  is harder -
Margin and padding is CSS
Inline vs Block Level Elements
Block <div>, <h1>

em and strong are not recommended anymore.

Tag attributes - key/value

Form
- We can build the look of the form, but we need a programming language of the dynamics of the form.
method="POST" - adding data to a database.
GET - not as secure because you can see what data is being put in.

text area - you can make it bigger or smaller.

alt - Showing error in case it something doesn't get shown

blockquote makes it centered
abbr  - if you however over it then you see the whole word.

What is a section supposed to do? I feel like it is similar to <p>

id can help you keep track of things

aside and small - more options to divide content
